# Day 5: Working with Numbers and Conditions

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**Task**: Determine if a given number is even or odd.

**Description**:  
An even number is divisible by 2, while an odd number is not. This task will help you practice using the modulus operator (`%`) and conditional statements.

**Instructions**:
1. Ask the user to enter a whole number.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if the number is even or odd:
   - If the number is even, print "The number is even."
   - If the number is odd, print "The number is odd."

**Expected Output**:
```python
Enter a number: 7
The number is odd
```

## Task 2: Simple Calculator for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division

**Task**: Create a simple calculator that performs a basic operation chosen by the user.

**Description**:  
In this task, youâ€™ll learn how to take multiple inputs and use conditional statements to perform different actions based on the user's choice.

**Instructions**:
1. Ask the user to enter two numbers.
2. Ask the user to choose an operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
3. Use `if-elif-else` statements to perform the chosen operation and display the result.

**Expected Output**:
```python
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): +
The result is: 15.0
