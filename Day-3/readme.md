# Day 3: Decision Making with `if` and `if-else`

## *Task*: Use `if` and `if-else` statements to solve a problem.

*Description*:  
The `if` statement lets you control the flow of your program based on conditions. Today, youâ€™ll practice using `if` and `if-else` statements to categorize age groups based on user input.

*Instructions*:  

- Write a program that asks for the user's age.
- Use `if` and `if-else` statements to print:
  - "Child" if age is less than 13.
  - "Teen" if age is between 13 and 19.
  - "Adult" if age is between 20 and 64.
  - "Senior" if age is 65 or older.

*Expected Output*:
```python

Enter your age = 16
You are a Teen

Enter your age = 10
You are a Child

Enter your age = 26
You are an Adult

Enter your age = 75
You are a Senior
