# Day 16: Working with Tuples

## Task: Create and Manipulate a Tuple

**Description**:  
A **tuple** is an immutable sequence in Python, often used to store fixed collections of items. In this task, you will:
1. Create a tuple of numbers.
2. Perform some basic operations on the tuple to practice accessing and using its elements.

---

### Instructions

1. Create a tuple with five integers.
2. Display the tuple.
3. Ask the user to input a number to check if it exists in the tuple.
4. Display the index of that number if it exists or inform the user it is not found.
5. Find and display the maximum and minimum numbers in the tuple.

---

###Expected Output

```python
The tuple is: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
Enter a number to check if it exists in the tuple: 30
The number 30 is at index 2.
The maximum number in the tuple is: 50
The minimum number in the tuple is: 10
