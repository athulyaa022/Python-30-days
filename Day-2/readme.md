# Day 2: User Input and Basic Calculations
## **Task**: Use the `input()` function to collect user input and perform calculations with it.

### **Description**:
The `input()` function allows you to take input from the user. It always returns the input as a string, so youâ€™ll need to convert it to the appropriate data type (like `int` or `float`) if you want to perform arithmetic with it.

### **Instructions**:
```python
1) Ask the user to input
number1 
number2

2) Perform the following arithmetic operations
sum
difference
product 
quotient 

3)Display the results


Output Example
(if user enters 8 and 4
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 4
Sum: 12
Difference: 4
Product: 32
Quotient: 2.0
