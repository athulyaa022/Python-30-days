Description:The input() function allows you to take input from the user.
 It always returns the input as a string, so youâ€™ll need to convert it to the appropriate data type
 (like int or float)if you want to perform arithmetic with it.

number1=int(input("Enter the first number:"))
number2=int(input("Enter the second number:"))
print("Sum:",number1+number2)
print("Difference:",number1-number2)
print("Product:",number1*number2)
print("Quotient:",number1/number2)
