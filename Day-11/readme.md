# Day 11: Working with Loops and Lists

## Task: Count Even and Odd Numbers in a List

**Task**: Write a program that counts the number of even and odd numbers in a list provided by the user.

**Description**:  
This task will help you practice:
1. Using loops to iterate through a list.
2. Applying conditions to categorize numbers as even or odd.
3. Counting occurrences using variables.

---

### Instructions

1. Ask the user to input numbers separated by spaces.
2. Use the `split()` method to convert the input into a list of strings and then convert it to integers.
3. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and check if each number is even or odd.
4. Keep a count of even and odd numbers using separate variables.
5. Print the counts of even and odd numbers.

### Expected Output

```python
Enter numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Even numbers: 3
Odd numbers: 3
