# Day 10: Using `while` Loops

## Task: Sum of Numbers from 1 to N

**Task**: Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to a user-specified number (`N`) using a `while` loop.

**Description**:  
A `while` loop is useful for repetitive calculations. In this task, you will:
1. Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `N`.
2. Display the total sum after the loop ends.

---

### Instructions

1. Ask the user to input a number (`N`).
2. Use a `while` loop to iterate from 1 up to `N` (inclusive).
3. Keep a running total of the numbers using a variable (`total`).
4. Print the total sum at the end.

###Expectred Output
```python

Enter a number: 5
The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15
