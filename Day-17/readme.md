# Day 17: Tuple Slicing and Unpacking

## Task: Work with Tuple Slicing and Unpacking

**Description**:  
Tuples support slicing, similar to lists, and allow unpacking of their values into variables. In this task, you will:
1. Create a tuple of mixed data types (numbers and strings).
2. Perform slicing to extract specific parts of the tuple.
3. Use unpacking to assign tuple elements to individual variables.

---

### Instructions

1. Create a tuple containing at least five elements (mix numbers and strings).  
2. Display the tuple.
3. Extract and display a slice of the first three elements.
4. Extract and display a slice of the last two elements.
5. Unpack the first three elements of the tuple into three variables and display them.

### Expected Output:

```python
The tuple is: (1, 'Python', 3.14, 'Code', 42)
The first three elements are: (1, 'Python', 3.14)
The last two elements are: ('Code', 42)
Unpacked values:
a = 1
b = Python
c = 3.14
