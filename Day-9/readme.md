# Day 9: Using `while` Loops

## Task: Find the First Odd Number in a Series

**Task**: Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers one by one and stops as soon as the user enters an odd number. 

**Description**:  
The `while` loop is useful for processing input repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this task, you will:
1. Use a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for a number.
2. Check if the number is odd.
3. Stop the loop and display a message when an odd number is entered.

### Instructions

1. Use the `input()` function to take a number from the user.
2. Use a `while` loop to keep asking for a number until the user enters an odd number.
3. Print a message such as `"You entered an odd number: <number>"` when the loop ends.

### Expected Output

```python
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 8
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 7
You entered an odd number: 7
