# Day 12: Sum of Digits in a Number

## Task: Write a program to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.

**Description**:  
Breaking down a number into its individual digits can be done using loops and arithmetic operations. In this task, you will:
1. Ask the user for a positive integer.
2. Use a loop to extract each digit of the number.
3. Add the digits together to calculate the total sum.
4. Print the result.

### Instructions

1. Ask the user to input a positive integer.
2. Use a `while` loop to extract digits one by one using the modulo operator (`%`) and integer division (`//`).
3. Keep a running total of the digits.
4. Print the sum of the digits.

### Expected Output

```python

Enter a positive integer: 12345
The sum of the digits is: 15
