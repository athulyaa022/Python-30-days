## Day 4: Basic Input and Output

*#Task1*: Use the `input()` function to receive user input and `print()` to display a message.

**Description**:  
The `input()` function allows users to enter information, which can then be processed or displayed. By combining `input()` with `print()`, you can create interactive programs that respond to user-provided data.

**Instructions**:
1. Write a program that asks the user for their name.
2. Then, ask the user for their age.
3. Finally, print a personalized message that includes both their name and age.

**Expecteed Output**:
```python
Enter your name: Anu
Enter your age: 25
Hello, Anu! You are 25 years old.
```





*#Task2*: Use `input()` and `print()` to process and display formatted information.

**Description**:  
In this task, you'll practice using the `input()` function and also work with formatted strings to display a more structured output. You'll calculate the user's age in months and display it alongside their name.

**Instructions**:
1. Ask the user for their name.
2. Ask the user for their age (in years).
3. Calculate their age in months (multiply their age by 12).
4. Display a message that includes:
   - Their name.
   - Their age in years.
   - Their age in months.

**Example**:
```python
Enter your name: Anu
Enter your age (in years): 25
Hello, Anu!
You are 25 years old, which is 300 months.
