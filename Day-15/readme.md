# Day 15: Sum of Multiples in a Range

## Task: Find the Sum of Multiples of a Number in a Range

**Description**:  
This task will help you practice working with nested loops and conditions. You will:
1. Ask the user to input a range of numbers (start and end).
2. Ask the user to input a number.
3. Calculate the sum of all multiples of the given number within the range.

---

### Instructions

1. Take two inputs from the user to define the range (start and end).
2. Take another input to specify the number whose multiples will be summed.
3. Use a loop to iterate through the range and check for multiples.
4. Calculate the sum and display it.

---

### Expected Output
```python
Enter the starting number of the range: 1
Enter the ending number of the range: 10
Enter the number to find multiples of: 3
The sum of multiples of 3 between 1 and 10 is: 18
