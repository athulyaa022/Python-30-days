# Day 8: Loops with Conditions

## Task: Find Even and Odd Numbers in a Range

**Task**: Write a program to identify and print all even and odd numbers within a specified range.

**Description**:  
Loops with conditions let you iterate through a sequence and apply specific rules to each element. In this task, youâ€™ll use a `for` loop to check each number in a range and determine whether it is even or odd.

---

### Instructions

1. Use the `input()` function to get two numbers from the user: a start number and an end number.
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all numbers in the range (inclusive of both start and end numbers).
3. Use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is even or odd.
4. Print each number along with whether it is "Even" or "Odd".

### Expected Output

```python
Enter the start of the range: 1
Enter the end of the range: 5
1 is Odd
2 is Even
3 is Odd
4 is Even
5 is Odd
