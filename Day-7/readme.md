# Day 7: Practicing `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in Loops 

## Task: Count to 10 with Special Conditions

**Task**: Write a program that counts from `1` to `10` and uses `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in specific situations.

**Description**:  
This task will give you hands-on practice with `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements:

- **`break`**: Ends the loop immediately.
- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code for the current iteration.
- **`pass`**: Does nothing and is a placeholder.

You will apply these statements based on conditions as you count from `1` to `10`.

### Instructions

1. Use a `for` loop to count from `1` to `10`.
2. **Using `continue`**: Skip printing the number `4`.
3. **Using `pass`**: Use `pass` when the number is `7`.
4. **Using `break`**: Stop the loop completely when the number `9` is reached.
